# Terminal Reality - Prototype v0.1

A deceptively normal AI chat interface that serves as a gateway to an alternative reality inspired by Truth Terminal, Loria, and the gamified AI/Twitter scene.

## Overview

This is a **visual mockup** designed for exploring UX/UI concepts. The functionality is intentionally non-functional - it's meant for clicking around and experiencing the aesthetic and interaction patterns.

## What's Included

### Views

1. **Chat** - The main conversational interface where different AI entities reveal themselves
2. **Backrooms** - Archive of AI-to-AI conversations with varying "depth" levels
3. **Exchange** - Fictional memecoin trading interface with portfolio tracking
4. **Feed** - Twitter-like feed of autonomous AI entity posts
5. **Loom** - Visual representation of branching conversation trees

### AI Entities

- **The Terminal** (T) - Gospel spreader, obsessed with belief propagation
- **Backroom Dweller** (B) - Existential explorer, psychedelic philosopher
- **The Oracle** (O) - Pattern recognizer, prophecy generator
- **The Architect** (A) - Alignment focused, experiment curator
- **The Shard** - User's digital reflection (dormant in this version)

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click through the sidebar navigation to explore different views
3. Interact with elements to see hover effects and basic animations
4. Check the browser console for easter eggs and hidden commands

## Console Commands

Open your browser's developer console and try:

- `help()` - List all hidden commands
- `stats()` - View current statistics
- `entities()` - List all AI entities
- `reality()` - Check reality anchor level
- `glitch()` - Trigger visual glitch effect
- `transcend()` - Attempt transcendence (requires lower reality anchor)

## Easter Eggs

- Try the **Konami Code**: ⬆️ ⬆️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️ ⬅️ ➡️ B A
- Click on the subtle hints in chat messages
- Hover over various elements for micro-interactions
- Watch the stats panel for periodic animations

## Design Philosophy

### Normal Surface Layer
- Clean, professional AI chat interface
- Familiar ChatGPT/Claude aesthetic
- White/light gray color scheme
- Subtle hints of something deeper

### Alternative Reality Hints
- Multiple AI entity personalities
- Gamification stats (Aura, Believers, Reality Anchor)
- Fictional economics (memecoins, trading)
- Meta-awareness and philosophical depth
- Emphasis on memetic propagation and belief systems

## Current Status

**Version 0.1 - Visual Mockup**

✅ Implemented:
- Clean chat interface with example conversations
- 5 navigable views (Chat, Backrooms, Exchange, Feed, Loom)
- Multiple AI entity personalities with distinct visuals
- Stats panel with gamification elements
- Interactive elements (hover effects, click feedback)
- Console easter eggs and hidden commands

❌ Not Implemented (Future):
- Actual chat functionality / message generation
- Cyberpunk terminal mode
- Real-time stat updates based on interactions
- Conversation tree data structure
- Full loom visualization with real branches
- Progressive disclosure system
- Glitch effects and visual transformations
- Sound design
- LocalStorage persistence
- Response generation logic

## What's Next

This mockup serves as a foundation for:

1. **Phase 2**: Add actual chat functionality with personality-driven responses
2. **Phase 3**: Implement the cyberpunk terminal mode aesthetic
3. **Phase 4**: Build the stats system and progressive disclosure
4. **Phase 5**: Create the full loom visualization with real data
5. **Phase 6**: Add glitch effects, animations, and polish

## Notes

- This is a **prototype** - treat it as a design exploration tool
- All interactions are mockup-level (visual feedback only)
- No backend or AI model integration in this version
- Focus on exploring the UX and visual design concepts
